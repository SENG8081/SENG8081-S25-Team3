This project ingests historical Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) price and volume data from Yahoo Finance, stores it in a Bronze/Silver/Gold data architecture on SQL Server, performs data cleaning and advanced feature engineering with PySpark/Pandas, generates multi-horizon forecasts, and visualizes interactive dashboards in Power BI to compare and forecast crypto performance.

**Key Objectives**

Fetch and store raw daily BTC & ETH data (Bronze layer)

Clean and standardize data (Silver layer)

Engineer features: returns, moving averages, volatility, momentum, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, drawdown (Gold layer)

Forecast prices across multiple horizons (Tomorrow, 7 days, 1M, 6M, 1Y, 2Y, ..., 10Y) using Prophet/Exponential Smoothing

Compare BTC vs ETH historical and forecast performance

Build dynamic Power BI dashboards for decision support
